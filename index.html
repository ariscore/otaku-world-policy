  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 21, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Otaku World is a mobile client for <a href="https://anilist.co">AniList.co</a>, enabling you to browse, track, and manage your anime and manga. We take your privacy seriously and only collect what’s necessary to power core app features.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 AniList Account Data</h3>
  <p>When you log in, AniList.co grants Otaku World an <em>access token</em>—we do not store your AniList credentials (email or password). The token lets us retrieve your username, avatar, and lists for display and synchronization.</p>

  <h3>2.2 Analytics & Performance</h3>
  <p>We may collect anonymous usage analytics (e.g., feature usage counts, crash reports) via a privacy‐centric provider. No personal identifiers are included, and analytics data cannot be traced back to you.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate and authorize via AniList.co for app functionality.</li>
    <li>To display and update your anime/manga lists in real time.</li>
    <li>To analyze anonymous usage data and prioritize app improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>All locally stored data is secured within your device’s standard sandbox. Access tokens and preferences are encrypted at rest.</p>

  <h2>5. Third‐Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AniList.co API</strong> for core content and account data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
  <p>Otaku World does not use cookies. Our analytics provider may place necessary local identifiers on your device; these are strictly anonymous and used only for performance insights.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with unassociated third parties. Data is only shared with the services listed above as required for functionality.</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Otaku World is not directed at children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will promptly delete it.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access / Correction:</strong> Contact us to review or correct your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can revoke AniList authorization or delete locally stored data via app settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes. Continued use after updates implies acceptance.</p>
